Various tools used in lots of code written by Zach Berta-Thompson (zkbt@mit.edu), primarily written in Python. It's a weird combination of odds and ends, that tend to be required by lots of programs. There is absolutely no guarantee that these will work for you, but please feel free to peruse the bits of code included here. I hope something may be helpful!
